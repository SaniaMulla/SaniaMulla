# Hi, I'm Sania Mulla! 👋

### 💻 **Computer Engineering Graduate | Frontend Developer | AI & LLM Enthusiast**


I'm a Computer Engineering graduate passionate about building intuitive digital experiences and smart AI-powered tools. I specialize in frontend development and I'm currently diving deep into the world of Large Language Models, AI chatbots, and agent-based systems.

My recent work includes developing a CoPilot-style chatbot using LangChain, FastAPI, and OpenAI's GPT models, and building full-stack applications with seamless user interaction. I blend creativity with technical skills to bring ideas to life, whether it’s crafting responsive web interfaces or integrating backend logic for AI-driven solutions.

Let’s build something meaningful.
